Having a weak password is not good for a system that demands high confidentiality and security of user credentials. It turns out that people find it difficult to make up a strong password that is strong enough to prevent unauthorized users from memorizing it. Passwords provide the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your computer and personal information. The stronger your password, the more protected your computer will be from hackers and malicious software. You should maintain strong passwords for all accounts on your computer.
