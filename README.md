# strong password generator
This is a simple password generator application that allows users to generate strong, unique, and secure passwords for their online accounts.
## Features
- Generate a random password with a length between 8 and 32 characters.
- Include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Copy the generated password to the clipboard with one click.
- No internet connection required because I use [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
- Lightweight and easy to use.
- I use [secrets library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html) which is the best source of cryptographic randomness.

## Installation
To use the password generator, simply download the repository and open the **password.py** file in your web browser.
