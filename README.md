## Features
- Generate a random password with a length between 8 and 32 characters.

- No internet connection required because I use [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
- Lightweight and easy to use.
- I use [secrets library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html) which is the best source of cryptographic randomness.
